```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run lint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Start the production server locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Database Notes

The schema is created automatically on first use when `DATABASE_URL` is configured.

Tables created by the server layer:

- `customers`
- `bookings`
- `booking_settings`

## Assets

Public assets remain in `public/`, including:

- `public/logo.png`
- `public/opengraph.jpg`
- `public/DKEU.svg`
- `public/videos/hero.mp4`
- `public/bilbrands/*`
- `public/robots.txt`

## Legacy Astro Source

The previous Astro implementation was preserved under:

```text
legacy/astro-src
```

This keeps the original pages, layouts, components, content files, and Astro APIs available for reference during the migration.

## Verification Done

The migration was verified with:

- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- Local HTTP checks against `/`, `/booking`, and `/admin/login`
